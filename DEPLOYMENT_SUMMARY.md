## 🧪 Testing the API

### Quick Test Commands:

   ```bash
   curl https://z2a5hah3zf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/customers
   ```

2. **Get specific customer:**
   ```bash
   curl https://z2a5hah3zf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/customers/53c667fc-bef8-41e5-a848-f7e1b82e0ca5
   ```

3. **Create new customer:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://z2a5hah3zf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/customers \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "first_name": "Test",
       "last_name": "User",
       "email_address": "test@example.com",
       "phone_number": "555-0199",
       "preferred_communication_channels": ["email"],
       "is_loyalty_member": "n",
       "lifetime_value": 100.00
     }'
   ```

## 📖 Documentation

**Swagger UI:** Open `swagger-ui.html` in your browser for interactive API documentation
- The Swagger UI is now configured with the correct API URL
- Test all endpoints directly from the browser interface

## 🏗️ Architecture Deployed

- **6 Lambda Functions** (Python 3.12)
  - CreateCustomerFunction
  - GetCustomerFunction
  - ListCustomersFunction
  - UpdateCustomerFunction
  - DeleteCustomerFunction
  - SeedDataFunction

- **1 DynamoDB Table** (Pay-per-request billing)
  - Table: `customers`
  - Primary Key: `customer_id` (String)

- **1 API Gateway** (REST API)
  - CORS enabled
  - All CRUD endpoints configured

## 💰 Cost Considerations

- **DynamoDB:** Pay-per-request (no fixed costs)
- **Lambda:** Pay-per-invocation (generous free tier)
- **API Gateway:** Pay-per-request
- **Estimated monthly cost for light usage:** < $5

## 🧹 Cleanup

To delete all resources and avoid charges:
```bash
./teardown.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name customer-management-api
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] SAM template deployed successfully
- [x] All 6 Lambda functions created
- [x] DynamoDB table created
- [x] API Gateway endpoints configured
- [x] Database seeded with 10 sample customers
- [x] API tested and working
- [x] Swagger UI configured with correct URL
- [x] CORS enabled for web access
- [x] Proper error handling implemented

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the API** using the Swagger UI or curl commands
2. **Customize** the customer model if needed
